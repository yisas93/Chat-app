Chat app created with React.js for the front-end and CSS styling, 
I also used Node.js for the backend as well as Socket.io to handle real-time communications between users
The app also features error handling and room and user validation
I'm in the process to add authentication using JWT and password hashing 
Overall, the project showcases my skills in developing responsive, real-time applications using modern web development technologies
